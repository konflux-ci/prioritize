"""
The reranking tries to keep the general ordering within the project.

If the issue being reranked and its parent belongs to the same project, the issue will
be reranked so as to be displayed next to the parent. E.g. all stories belonging to an
Epic will be listed after the parent Epic and before the next highest ranked Epic.

If Features from ProjectA are reranked, it will not impact the global position of
Features from ProjectB within the project.
What that means is that:
    1.  All issues related to same parent are moved as a block, keeping the ranking in
        that block. An issue without a parent is considered as a block.
    2.  When parent issues are reranked, blocks related to the parent issue's project
        are reordered. The reordering is done by swapping blocks around. Blocks can
        be swapped only if they are related to the same parent project.
Example:
    Epic1 and Epic2 are related to FeatureA from ProjectX.
    Epic3 is related to FeatureB from ProjectY.
    Epic4 does not have a parent issue.
    Epic5 is related to FeatureC from ProjectX.
    Current ranking in the project, showing blocks:
        [Epic1, Epic2], [Epic3], [Epic4], [Epic5]
    Current ranking in ProjectA:
        FeatureA, FeatureC
    If the ranking in ProjectA changes to:
        FeatureC, FeatureA
    the ranking in the project will become:
        [Epic5], [Epic3], [Epic4], [Epic1, Epic2]
    The 2 blocks for FeatureA and FeatureB have been swapped, wihtout impacting the
    ranking of the other issues.

Blocks can be moved and ranked lower if the parent status is not "In Progress".
This helps prioritize the work that is currently on-going rather than future
improvements that have been ranked very high.
